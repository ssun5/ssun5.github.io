How does one reference a tool to a deformable soft surface? By applying a matrix of fiducial markers, it is possible to create a high-precision motion tracking system along a deformable surface. Even a low-cost webcam shown here is capable of delivering sub-millimeter precision when tested against ground-truth models.
