How does one reference a tool to a deformable soft surface? By applying a matrix of fiducial markers, it is possible to create a high-precision motion tracking system along a deformable surface. Even a low-cost webcam shown here is capable of delivering sub-millimeter precision when tested against ground-truth models.

An inline math: \\\(E=mc^2\\\).

A display math:

$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}
\frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} + V \Psi
$$
